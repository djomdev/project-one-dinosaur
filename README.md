# Project One - Dinosaur

## Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree - Diego Ortega

### Project Overview

The first project for the Udacity's Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree is an infographic that is derived from data that is provided, as well as user input data. This projects requires Object-oriented javascript skills taken from the first course of the ntermediate JavaScript Nanodegree syllabus. In this project, the app will be pulling in information from a form and using it to complete an array of objects that will then be appended back to the DOM.

For the project, it is necessary to generate a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, you will display the name of the human rather than species and no fact is necessary for the human. When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden. The facts displayed should be random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts (3 should be from the methods you create). One of the titles should be for a pigeon in which the tile should always display, “All birds are considered dinosaurs.”

### Project Requirements

To complete this project, the UI must show the following:

- [ ] The form should contain a button which upon clicking, removes the form
- [ ] The button should append a grid with 9 tiles to the DOM with the Human located in the center
- [ ] The Human tile should display the name of the person and an image, the dino tiles should contain the species, an image and a fact, the bird title should contain the species, image, and "All birds are Dinosaurs."

To complete this project, your backend code must:

- [ ] Contain a class and all necessary objects
- [ ] Contain at least 3 methods for comparing dinosaurs to the human
- [ ] Get user data from the DOM
- [ ] Append tiles with object data to DOM

Install live-server for testing:
